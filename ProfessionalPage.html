                <h4>Communication</h4>
                <p>
                    I have always loved working with people and nothing makes me happier than coming together on a
                    technology project to create something great. In past roles I’ve used this skill in many capacities
                    including working as team leader, account manager, negotiator, and webinar presenter. Maybe even
                    more important than communication, I am also a good listener – working to identify broad needs and
                    translate them into actionable events.

                <h4>Organization</h4>
                <p>
                    Attention to detail is a critical skill in technology and it has a presence beyond lines of code. In
                    the past I’ve worked to organize projects keep a keen eye out not only for minute process details
                    but also aspects like presentation, messaging, and product value. These individual pieces come
                    together holistically creating value, efficiencies, and intuitive resources.

                <h4>Vision</h4>
                <p>
                    It can be difficult to see beyond the day to day and in many cases this is what holds teams back
                    from making positive changes. In my role with Esri I learned to see across organizations to better
                    understand how teams are interwoven and how individual processes can impact people across teams. By
                    leveraging business acumen and creativity I’ve been able companies get better at what they do.
