        <h4>New Customer Form</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px">
            This was one of the projects completed during my technology internship with a regional accounting firm. The
            goal was to redesign an existing form used by internal staff to add new clients to various internal company
            databases and resources. By completing this application multiple teams were able to save countless hours,
            reduce errors, and streamline processes. In addition to a new form I also implemented home pages for staff
            to reference work and track progress. The technologies used include .Net Core, Blazor, Microsoft SQL,
            and several other resources.

            <br />
            <br />

            Through this experience I was able to leverage my software, communication, and organization skills to help
            create a valuable resource for the
            organization. Additionally, I learned a great deal about the importance of project planning and how critical
            management skills are to the overall process and the time it takes to deliver a product. Teamwork is also
            very important especially in the context of a project involving multiple business teams.

            <br />
            <br />

            Due to the sensitive nature of the application I am unable to publicly post the code but have included
            images below.

        <h4>Address Book</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px">
            This was a class assignment designed to work as an electronic address book taking in various pieces of
            information about contacts. It offers the ability to use a number of multi-level sorting functions, to add
            and remove contacts, and an option to display single contacts based on an e-mail address. The program was
            made in Python using PyCharm.

        <h4>Capital Gains Calculator</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px">
            This was a class assignment made in Java and uses a queue to calculate capital gains for a stock based on
            purchases and sales entered by the user.

        <h4>Encryptor</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 10px"> 
            This is a small C# program which uses a graphical interface to encrypt and decrypt sets of numbers.
